This project focuses on predicting and classifying diamond prices using various machine learning and data science techniques. The dataset utilized contains various attributes related to diamonds, such as weight, cut quality, color, clarity, dimensions, and price. The main goal is to understand the relationships between these features and the price of diamonds, perform feature engineering, and ultimately classify the diamonds into different price categories.

Key Steps in the Project:
Data Importing and Preprocessing:

The project begins with importing the diamond dataset from Kaggle, followed by data cleaning, handling missing values, and removing duplicates to ensure data integrity.
Feature Encoding and Mapping:

Non-numeric features such as cut quality, color, and clarity are transformed into numerical values using mapping dictionaries, making them suitable for machine learning algorithms.
Data Visualization:

Various data visualization techniques, such as pair plots and box plots, are used to explore relationships between features and detect outliers.
Outlier Detection and Removal:

Outliers in numerical features are identified using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method and removed to improve model performance.
Handling Distribution and Skewness:

Distributions of numeric features are visualized, and transformations (log, square root, boxcox) are applied to handle skewness and normalize the data.
Feature Selection:

A correlation heatmap and statistical models are used to identify important features that significantly influence the target variable (price).
Price Classification:

Diamonds are categorized into different price classes (low, medium, high) using binning. A Logistic Regression model is employed to classify these price classes with metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall being evaluated.
Clustering Analysis:

K-Means clustering is applied to group diamonds based on selected features. Mutual Information Scores help identify the most relevant features for clustering. Clusters are analyzed against the price classes, providing insights into patterns within the data.
Model Evaluation and Comparison:

The project compares the performance of clustering against logistic regression. Key metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 scores are used to evaluate the effectiveness of each approach, highlighting areas where clustering can approximate class labels closely.
Unique Aspects of the Project:
Data Engineering and Transformation: Extensive feature encoding, outlier handling, and transformation methods are employed to improve data quality and enhance the predictive capabilities of models.
Multi-Approach Analysis: Both supervised (Logistic Regression) and unsupervised (Clustering) techniques are used, offering a comprehensive analysis of diamond pricing.
Evaluation Metrics: Detailed comparison of classification and clustering methods provides a robust understanding of model strengths and weaknesses, guiding future refinements.
This project serves as a practical application of machine learning techniques in the field of e-commerce and luxury goods, demonstrating how data-driven approaches can be used to classify and understand pricing structures in the diamond market.
